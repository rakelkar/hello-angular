# Learning Angular

## Basic building blocks:
| Example                                                                  | Link             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Basic form (e.g. Id, Name, Gender) (no submit yet) |[simpleform](site/simpleform.html) |
| Basic form lookup by Id and update | [validatingform](site/validatingform.html)|
| Basic validation on form (e.g. age is numeric) | |
| Checkbox to expose a subtable e.g. habits | |
| Dynamic number of rows for subtable | |
| API to accept json and write to DB (python) | |
| Form submit for basic form data to DB via API | |
| Form submit with subtable(s) | |
| Paginated table of data entered with link to form view | |
| Main window (no login - as we dont do false security, just none or real) | |
| CSS to make it look shiny and nice | |
